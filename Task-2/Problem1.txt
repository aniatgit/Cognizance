step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Declare Divisor, Dividend, and Remainder as Floating Values
Step 3 : Declare Quotient as Integer
Step 4 : Assign Divisor as 3
Step 5 : Take Dividend as Input
Step 6 : Quotient = Divisor / Dividend
Step 7 : Remainder = (Dividend / Divisor) - Quotient
Step 8 : if 
           Remainder == 0 
           Output is True
         else
           Output is False
Step 9 : End
