Step 1 : Declare Integer Variables a, b, c, i, n
Step 2 : Assign Values for a and b as 1 as starting values of array 
Step 3 : Assign c as 0 as a extra varible to place values
Step 4 : Assign i as 3 representing the number of iterations
Step 5 : Take input n for the nth number
Step 6 : while (i<=n)
         calculating the value of the next number in the series
 	 till we find the nth number
Step 7 : Output c when the while loop is finished
